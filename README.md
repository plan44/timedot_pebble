[![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=luz&url=https://github.com/plan44/timedot_pebble&title=timedot&language=&tags=github&category=software)

This watchface shows time and date (as too many standard watchfaces don't show the date), and reuses the wandering seconds dot from the [Ziit watchface](https://github.com/plan44/ziit_pebble)

TimeDot Pebble Watchface is licensed under the MIT License (see LICENSE.txt).

The only requirement of this license is that you *must include the copyright
and the license text* when you distribute apps based on this code.

**Important**: This code is based on Pebble's early beta or even alpha proof-of-concept SDK, so it is highly probable this code will break and need adaption in the near future as Pebble SDK matures. **Use entirely on you own risk**.

To install and use the pebble SDK, please follow the instructions at [developer.getpebble.com/2](https://developer.getpebble.com/2/).

To install the compiled watchface, just go to the [pebble appstore] (https://getpebble.com), or use the already compiled watchface (.pbw file) in the built_app/ folder.
